# **User Event Tracking Api Application**

## üåê **API**

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Setup**

- Clone this repo and open the project in your IDE (I am using Visual Studio Code):
- To get started, from the project root create a `.env` file and copy-üçù the contents of `.env.sample` into it (refer to the "Environment Variables" table below for local values)
- Create your virtual environment (for `venv` users, this is: `python3 -m venv api && source api/bin/activate`)
- Next, set up the database with: `make setup-db`. Before moving to the next step, confirm you see 'Started' for 'Container postgres' in your terminal, like this:
```
[+] Running 3/3

 ‚úî Container postgres                        Started                                                                                                                                                   0.0s 
```
- To start the app itself, run: `make start-api`
- Before making any `Event` in the database, you need to create some `Person` rows (this is because an event is intended to be associated with a person). This can be done easily if you have Postman installed and upload the collection I included in `api/docs/User Events Api Application.postman_collection.json`.

<details>
<summary>Environment Variables</summary>

_While there is only one environment currently (local), variables for database connections, authentication, and other sensitive information would need to be changed for non-local development_.

| Env Variable | Local Value | Description & Usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DB_HOST` | `"localhost"` | The host for the PostgreSQL database |
| `DB_NAME` | `"postgres"` | The name of the PostgreSQL database |
| `DB_PASS` | `"password"` | The password for the PostgreSQL database |
| `DB_PORT` | `6543` | The port for the PostgreSQL database |
| `DB_USER`  | `"dev"` |The user of the PostgreSQL database (PostgreSQL requires this) |
| `ENVIRONMENT` | `"local"` | Denotes the current development environment |
| `SHOW_ERROR_DETAILS` | `false` | Allows exception details to be surfaced directly from failing web requests as described [here]("https://www.neoteroi.dev/blacksheep/application/#handling-errors"). To avoid security issues, this is `false` by default and will only be `true` if `ENVIRONMENT="local"` |

<summary>Tasks & Commands</summary>

<br/>

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `make start-api` | Starts the api (assuming the database is already running successfully) |
| `make setup-db` | Sets up PostgreSQL database in a docker container |

### üîó **Routes & Requests**

OpenApi Documentation can be found locally at http://127.0.0.1:8080/docs. Additionally, a Postman Collection has been included for convenience (see api/docs/User Events Api Application.postman_collection.json). Import it directly into Postman to begin playing with the api. It includes collection variables and pre-request scripts for dynamic POST requests, but it does not include environment variables. You will need to add an environment variable yourself called `base_url`. It's value should be `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

For those who don't have Postman, Routes & Requests are included in the dropdowns below

### üóÑÔ∏è **Data & Migrations**

Migrations are managed with the `piccolo` package.

New migrations need to be created whenever there is a change to the database schema. To create a new migration, use the following (always include a brief description): `piccolo migrations new db --desc="good description of migration here"`.

To apply the migration, use `piccolo migrations forwards all`.

## üí¨ **DISCUSSION**

_Originally I wanted to create an api that allowed for the creation of both events and users. I already had a boilerplate CRUD api that I was working on and it had Person objects so I thought, "Why not?". For this reason, `Persons` are included in the project. The linkage between `Person` and `Event` isn't complete but I'm still working on that. I focused my attention on the `Event` functionality, which includes the ability to search by a keyword._

I chose [blacksheep](https://www.neoteroi.dev/blacksheep/) for my framework because (A) I was already playing with it, (B) it's new and different to me, and (C) I am fascinated by its blend of Python + .NET. It seems like the best of both worlds and I was intrigued by the promise of maintainability, type safety, and speed of performance. I used [Piccolo ORM](https://github.com/piccolo-orm/piccolo) for database interactions because it was recommended by Blacksheep's [Roberto Prevato](https://github.com/Neoteroi/BlackSheep/commits?author=RobertoPrevato) but also because after a galumping through SQLAlchemy docs for what felt like decades, 30 minutes spent on Piccolo's offerings convinced me it was feature-rich and worth trying (the `auto_increment` option for a `Timestamp`, the [Playground](https://piccolo-orm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/piccolo/getting_started/playground.html), `piccolo admin`, and simple [Postgres setup](https://piccolo-orm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/piccolo/getting_started/setup_postgres.html) are all great examples). For data validation, I am using `Pydantic`, which handily ships with `Piccolo`.

As for architecture, I was going for a microservices approach. This is a small project so I began with a single file (`server.py`) which contains the database connection logic, routing, and 'service layer methods'. I do not enjoy how crowded it has become and I intend to simplify everything by separating `routes` from `service` logic and streamlining errors, exceptions, responses and if/else conditions.

After doing some light reading about events and event sourcing, I decided to use a very simple Event table structure and a `JSONB` string which can be searched with the `arrow` function provided by `Piccolo` (in the same way as a `->>` is used in raw SQL). After running into some limitations in my current knowledge, however, I left some comments and used `Varchar` for my simple event model.
